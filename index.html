      <p>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
         <br>To the last syllable of recorded time;<br>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
         <br>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
         <br>And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>Signifying nothing.</p>

    <p>I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor<wbr>
        That's not my business<wbr>
        I don't want to rule or conquer anyone<wbr>
        I should like to help everyone if possible<wbr>
        Jew, Gentile, Black Man, White<wbr>
        We all want to help one another, human beings are like that<wbr>
        We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery<wbr>
        We don't want to hate and despise one another<wbr>
        And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone<wbr>
        The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way<wbr>
        Greed has posioned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed<wbr>
        We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in<wbr>
        Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want<wbr>
        Our knowledge has made us cynincal<wbr>
        Our cleverness, hard and unkind<wbr>
        We think too much, and feel too little<wbr>
        More than machinery, we need humanity<wbr>
        More that cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness<wbr>
        Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost<wbr>
        The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together<wbr>
        The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all<wbr>
        Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people<wbr>
        To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair<wbr>
        The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress<wbr>
        The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people<wbr>
        And so long as men die, liberty will never perish<wbr></p>

    <p>Soldiers!<br>
        Don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel!<wbr>
        Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder<wbr>
        Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!<wbr>
        You are not machines!<wbr>
        You are not cattle!<wbr>
        You are men!<wbr>
        You have the love of humanity in your hearts!<wbr>
        You don't hate!<wbr>
        Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural!<wbr>
        Soldiers!<wbr>
        Don't fight for slavery!<wbr>
        Fight for liberty!<wbr>
        In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: "the Kingdom of God is within man" - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men!<wbr>
        In you!<wbr>
        You, the people have the power - the power to create machines<wbr>
        The power to create happiness!<wbr>
        You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure<wbr>
        Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite<wbr>
        Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security<wbr>
        By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power<wbr>
        But they lie!<wbr>
        They do not fulfil that promise<wbr>
        They never will!<wbr>
        Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people!<wbr>
        Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!<wbr>
        Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance<wbr>
        Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness<wbr>
        Soldiers!<wbr>
        In the name of democracy, let us all unite</p>
